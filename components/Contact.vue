          We value:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
          <li>Growth mindset - we encourage ourselves and others to get outside of our comfort zone.</li>
          <li>Empathy and trust - we love finding the commonality between people, rather than focusing on their differences.</li>
          <li>Openness and advocacy - to diversity and inclusion + to do what is right for the user/society as a whole.</li>
          <li>User-centricity - users of technology (and society as a whole) are at the center of what we build and what we do.</li>
          <li>Curiosity and humility - we are humble and know we can learn something from everyone.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
          Weâ€™re built on the foundation of our values and we are looking for like-minded optimists who want to be part of our journey.
          If this resonates with you, we would love to hear from you. You can reach us at:
